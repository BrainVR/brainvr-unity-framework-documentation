# FAQ
*Q: Newtonsoft namespace cannot be found?*

A: This is most commonly caused by the default settings of the unity player to use .NET 2.0 subset, rather than full 2.0. Change that settings in the Edit/Project Settings/Player. If you still have issues, it is possible something went wrong with cloning of .dll file. Grab new one from [newtonsoft](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) and replace the bad one.
